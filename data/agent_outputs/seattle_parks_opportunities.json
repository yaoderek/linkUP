    "activity_description": "These courses are intended for 15+ teens and adults at different levels of swimming ability. Learning the Basics and Refining Swim Strokes can help teens or adults overcome their fear of the water, learn the basic skills to achieve a minimum level of water competency, and who want to improve their foundational skills and swimming strokes to gain an overall level of comfort in the water. In this course, participants strive for skill and stroke performance to be able to enjoy the water more safely with their children, because they own a home pool or to open the door to training for other aquatic opportunities. (The American Red Cross Swim App is a great tool to track your swimmer's progression through skills learned. Students are grouped by skills rather than levels.

This player can rally an average of 4-6 balls with a partner, but needs guidance with directional control, stroke technique, the correct grips, and footwork. This player can also make volley contact but feels uncomfortable at the net. Additionally, this class is for players that are almost ready for competitive play but need some help on scoring and playing a match. Students can only advance with instructor or manager approval.

This player can rally an average of 4-6 balls  with a partner, but needs guidance with directional control, stroke technique,  the correct grips, and footwork. This player can also make volley contact but  feels uncomfortable at the net. Additionally, this class is for players that  are almost ready for competitive play but need some help on scoring and playing  a match. Students must have a 2.0 rating on their account to register.",

    "activity_description": "This class is for players that can sustain a minimum rally of 10-15 balls at medium pace with forehand or backhand and can mix in different spins throughout a rally. PLAY INSTRUCTS ARE GENERALLY MORE TACTICAL, AND LESS TECHNICAL (MORE APPLYING THE SKILLS). This class is generally more geared towards doubles play. Players have improved directional control and power and are developing better spin. Players still struggle to control/produce faster paced, deep or high shots, but are improving. Court coverage & positioning are improved and is starting to look for opportunities to come to the net, especially in doubles. Starting to serve with improved power and control and is developing spin ? especially on second serves. Exhibits improved net play, but still struggles to put volleys away. Students can only advance with instructor or manager approval. In the case that a player signs up at the wrong level, the tennis center will try to find an appropriate leveled class, but there is no guarantee due to available space. Students may only register for classes at their skill level, and NOT multiple classes at varying skill levels.    This will be a 5-class session. There is NO class on Thursday March 6th due to a staff in-service. Price is reflective of this.",

Learn the specifics of what to eat based on the work of Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr., the author of \"Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease\", in this fun-filled class that teaches how to set-up your kitchen, grocery shop, and prepared healthy meals. We'll learn how to make meals and snacks come together quickly and easily, and cover tips for eating out successfully, being a guest for meals, how to use an instant pot and more. The class is taught by a retired high school teacher who uses entertaining resources from notable plant-based leaders: Chef AJ, psychologist Dr. Doug Lisle, nutritionist Jeff Novick and Dr. Esselstyn and his family. Bonus: this way of eating can also lead to achieving and maintaining optimal weight. Note: We will not be cooking in this class, but some samples will be provided.  Instructor: Jeanie O",
